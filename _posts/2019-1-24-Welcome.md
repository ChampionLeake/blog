Below are links to my write-ups/articles regarding any of my reverse-engineering projects. See how things were made from my start to finish and I hope y'all learn and enjoy the findings I post. :)

* [Stack-Smashing PS1 savegames](https://championleake.github.io/articles/PS1-StackSmashing.html): Here's my small write-up on stack-smashing PS1 savegames.
* [Finding DSiWare Vulnerabilities](https://championleake.github.io/articles/finding-dsiware-vulns.html): Here is a writeup/tutorial on how you can find vulnerabilites in DSiWare applications.
* Implementing NDS-HBMenu to exploitable DSiWare apps: Coming soon
